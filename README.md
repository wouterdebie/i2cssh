## NOTE (fall 2022)

I finally took some time to rewrite `i2cssh` in python. For a while now Iterm2 has had a python API that allows you to automate a bunch of stuff. This python implementation uses that API to do the same thing as the original ruby script. This should make this app more maintainable, since it doesn't rely on any weird AppleScript bindings and emitting key codes. Secondly, it should be quite a bit faster in generating the ssh windows.

I've regained new interest, so if you find a bug, please report! Make sure to include your configuration!

# i2cssh

`i2cssh` is a csshX (http://code.google.com/p/csshx/) like tool for connecting ssh to multiple machines using ssh. But instead of creating separate windows and having a master window for input, `i2cssh` uses [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) split panes and allows to "Send input to all sessions" (âŒ˜-shift-I) to send commands to all sessions.

## Features

- Opening sessions in the current or new tabs
- Multiple cluster configuration
- Enable broadcast by default
- Multiple profiles
- Configurable SSH and shell parameters
- Custom layouts

## Installing

    $ brew install wouterdebie/repo/i2cssh

Make sure to enable the Python API in Iterm2. Go to Preferences -> General -> Magic -> Enable Python API.

`i2cssh` will assume you want to connect to a cluster when only one host is given.

For `-c` and `-m` options, the format `username@cluster` or `username@host` can be used.

The following commands are exactly the same, however, they might serve different purposes:

    $ i2cssh -m user1@host1,user2@host2
    $ i2cssh user1@host1 user2@host2

You can combine these options and use them multiple times:

    $ i2cssh -m user1@host1,user2@host2 user4@host3 user5@host4

Using the `-l` option will override all usernames:

    $ i2cssh -l foo user1@host1 user2@host2

This will connect to both `host1` and `host2` as the user `foo`

## i2csshrc

The `i2csshrc` file is a YAML formatted file that contains the following structure:

```yaml
---
version: 2
[optional parameters]
clusters:
    mycluster:
    [optional parameters]
    hosts:
        - host1
        - host2
```

Optional parameters can be used globally or per cluster and include:

```yaml
broadcast: (true/false) # Enable/disable broadcast on start
login: <username> # Use this username for login
profile: <iTerm2 profile> # Use this iTerm profile
rank: (true/false) # Enable sending LC_RANK as an environment variable
columns: <cols> # Amount of columns
rows: <rows> # Amount of rows
sleep: <secs> # Seconds to sleep between creating SSH sessions
direction: (column/row) # Direction that new sessions are created (default: column)
shell: <shell> # Shell to use (default: /bin/bash)

environment: # Send the following enviroment variables
  - LC_FOO: foo
  - LC_BAR: bar
```

Note: rows and columns can't be used at the same time.

Clusters can also include hosts from other clusters through a cluster specific optional parameter `include_from`:

```yaml
version: 2
clusters:
  cluster1:
    hosts:
      - host1
      - host2
  cluster2:
    hosts:
      - host3
      - host4
    include_from:
      - cluster1
```

Note that only the hosts will be included, but no additional configuration options. Secondly, includes
aren't transitive, so if `cluster1` includes `cluster2`, which in turn includes `cluster3`, only the
hosts from `cluster2` will be included in `cluster1`.

The following precedence is used:

`global options from config` < `cluster options from config` < `command line flags`

Make sure the config file is valid YAML (e.g. use spaces instead of tabs)

| <nobr>`-x, --custom-command`</nobr>       | Use a custom command to connect to the hosts. This will override the default `ssh` command. Use `{host}` as a substitution for the actual host will be used. E.g. `-x "kubectl exec -it {host} -- /bin/bash"` to execute `kubectl` instead of `ssh` |

## TODO

- Better release process (homebrew update after new release)
- Proper handling of resizing and full screen when the window is too small for the amount of rows or columns.

## Contributing to i2cssh

I know that `i2cssh` doesn't have all the functionality of csshX, but either let me know what you really need or fork, hack and create a pull request.

- Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
- Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
- Fork the project
- Start a feature/bugfix branch
- Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
